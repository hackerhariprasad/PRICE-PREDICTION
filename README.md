# PRICE--PREDICTION--USING--AI
Implemented advanced machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. Conducted in-depth data analysis to
identify crucial patterns for accurate predictions.
create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables . To know the accuracy of the model, i.e.
how well these variables can predict house prices.
