# PRICE--PREDICTION--USING--AI
To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. area, number of rooms, bathrooms, etc.  To create a linear model that quantitatively relates house prices with variables .  To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict house prices.
Implemented advanced machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling. Conducted in-depth data analysis to
identify crucial patterns for accurate predictions.
